# About Cypress

```
Cypress is a JavaScript End to End Testing or UI testing framework. It makes end to end testing, debugging, reporting excitingly easy. Cypress explains here https://www.cypress.io/how-it-works the details on different features it holds.

```

# Package.json dependencies 

```
- cypress: Main framework which allows end to end testing.

- cypress-cucumber-preprocessor: Allows us to integrate gherkin cucumber syntax for easy business readability. Also, I have used the Page object model which makes it easy to understand.

- cypress-testing-library: Custom commands which supports selecting elements in DOM by just using text. Eliminates CSS selector headaches.
fs-extra: Used for reading JSON file for setting different configuration for different environments.

- cross-env: No need to explicitly match syntax for setting environment variables in windows or Linux or UNIX machines.
